# Temple Transcript Request
### What is an official transcript?
An official transcript is your certified academic record.  An official transcript displays the terms you attended, graded courses, academic programs, and other relevant academic information. 

Current students, former students and alumni can place an order for an official paper transcript or an electronic transcript (eTranscript).

***Unofficial transcript:***

Office of the University Registrar does not provide copies of unofficial transcripts. Unofficial transcripts are available for review in Self-Service Banner for current students and alumni.

Transcript key explaining the grading system is available for download.

I reformatted the text so that it's broken up into smaller headings. Previsouly, the document was one long paragraph describing the process of requesting an online transcript.
In my edits, I made one heading and broke the text up into subheadings. This allows the reader to skim the text to find answers to their questions.
Also, I bolded important information readers need to know when going through this process. This includes unoffical transcipt, student repsonisbility, and frequently asked questions. 
I believe these revisions made the document more accessible and readibly while keeping the original content intact.
