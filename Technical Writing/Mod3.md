## Chapter 1: Managing for Quality - A Process Model

In this chapter, Hackos outlines the importance of quality in technical publications. He begins with how quality in technical publications provides a sense of personal and professional satisfaction among writers by producing information that satifies the needs of their customers. However, he cautions against "manufacturing quality" or fosucing on aspects of technical publications that are most easily measured. The quality of the publication must essentially make sense to the user. Quality is only accomplished when writers add value to their publications. 

Some tips he suggests for adding value to technical publications include understanding the issue of quality itself. It is both economical and emotional as it must be understanding for a diverse group of users. Not everyone can understand and process information like a technical writer. Technical writers must understand their audience. This can be achieved through a set of standards and quality checks by an efficent project manager.

By setting standards and quality checks, a project manager can hire anyone from experieced users to users who are eager to learn. This way, they can manage a team to produce a high quality technical publication with value, reduce training costs and customer support, lower the barriers for discretionary and infrequent users, and ultimately increase sales of their product.

Overall, putting time and attention into the right resources will produce a better quality technical publication. It may seem expensive and extraneous in the beggining, but it will pay off in the long wrong for any business.
